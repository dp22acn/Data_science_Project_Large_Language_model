Large Language Models (LLMs) for Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Reviews
Overview
This project focuses on training a transformer-based model to classify IMDb movie reviews as either positive or negative. Using pre-trained transformer architectures (such as BERT), the model's performance is enhanced through hyperparameter optimization techniques for more accurate sentiment prediction. The project showcases how fine-tuning these models and optimizing parameters can result in improved accuracy for text classification tasks.

Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a robust sentiment analysis model using large language models (LLMs) like BERT to categorize IMDb reviews. The project also emphasizes the use of state-of-the-art techniques, such as hyperparameter optimization with Optuna, for fine-tuning the model's performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IMDb movie review dataset, which contains reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset was split into:

Training Set: 5000 reviews (balanced between positive and negative)

Testing Set: 2000 reviews

Methodology
Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for model training, the text reviews were tokenized using the BERT uncased tokenizer from the Hugging Face transformers library. This step transformed unstructured text into structured input suitable for model training.

Model Architecture
We used a pre-trained transformer model (BERT) and fine-tuned it for sentiment classification. The fine-tuning process involved adjusting hyperparameters to optimize performance. The model's parameters were optimized with Optuna to improve learning rates, batch sizes, weight decay, and other hyperparameters.

Training and Testing
The transformer model was trained on the IMDb dataset to predict binary sentiment (positive or negative).

The fine-tuning process was carried out using Optuna, which helped fine-tune key parameters like learning rates and batch sizes to achieve the best performance.

The model was evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Key Findings
Model Accuracy: The final model achieved an accuracy of 92.3%, demonstrating its strong ability to classify sentiment.

F1-Score: A balanced F1-Score of 0.92 was achieved, indicating good performance for both positive and negative classes.

Loss and Performance: The loss function showed a steady decline during training, with variations indicating areas where additional fine-tuning could be applied.

Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: 92.3%

Precision: Excellent precision, especially for predicting positive reviews.

Recall & F1-Score: Both metrics showed high values, ensuring a balanced performance across both classes.

Performance Visualization
Text Length Distribution
A histogram visualizing the distribution of review lengths in the IMDb dataset shows that the majority of reviews are between 0 and 2000 characters. This analysis helps inform preprocessing steps like padding or token reduction.

Results
The model demonstrated impressive performance, especially when fine-tuned using advanced techniques. Additionally, the training setup proved that stronger GPUs could push accuracy closer to 97% with extended training time. The GPU timeout during testing slightly impacted performance but didn’t affect overall results significantly.

Limitations
The dataset used in this project is relatively small, and the results may not generalize well to other domains or larger datasets. Future work will involve:

Extending training with additional epochs.

Testing with more transformer models (e.g., RoBERTa, T5).

Fine-tuning hyperparameters further, such as learning rate and batch size optimization, to improve performance.

Expanding the dataset to increase the model’s robustness.

Future Work
Experimenting with other transformer models (e.g., RoBERTa, T5).

Fine-tuning on larger and more diverse datasets for better generalization.

Additional hyperparameter tuning to mitigate overfitting and improve performance.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of BERT in sentiment analysis tasks, showcasing its ability to classify IMDb reviews with high accuracy and balance. By leveraging fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, the model can achieve impressive results, making it a strong candidate for sentiment classification tasks.
